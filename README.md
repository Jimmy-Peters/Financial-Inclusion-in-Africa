# Financial-Inclusion-in-Africa
## To predict who in Africa is most likely to have a bank account?

You are asked to predict the likelihood of the person having a bank account or not (Yes = 1, No = 0), for each unique id in the test dataset . You will train your model on 70% of the data and test your model on the final 30% of the data, across four East African countries - Kenya, Rwanda, Tanzania, and Uganda.
The main dataset contains demographic information and what financial services are used by approximately 33,600 individuals across East Africa. This data was extracted from various Finscope surveys ranging from 2016 to 2018, and more information about these surveys can be found here:
